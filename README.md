# Asterius 2023-2024

## Who are we?
We are **Asterius**, a team of students from the Model High School of **[Evangeliki Scholi Smyrna](http://lyk-evsch-n-smyrn.att.sch.gr/wordpress/)** taking part in the **[CanSat in Greece](https://cansat.gr)** competition.

## Our Mission
This year, we have chosen to create a CanSat, which **splits into smaller counterparts** mid-flight. The purpose of our idea is to effectively cover a vast area of land, on earth or other planets, in order to sample environmental data. After the CanSats have successfully landed, they will establish **a network with each other**. The main body will act as the **"chief of operations" of the network**. Every counterpart will **continuously collect and send** data to the main body. The main body, in turn, has to **collect data** from all the subsequent "minions", **compile the received data** in one bigger batch of data and then **send the batch altogether** to our base of operations. In case the main body **fails to initialise/establish itself** properly, a minion will be **randomly** selected as the chief, fulfilling the same work. Following the same logic, a minion will be **disconnected** from the network **should it not establish itself at initialisation**.

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the software **code** for our CanSat's main body. The code for the "minions" will be a smaller scale version of the code presented here. Team members can easily utilise this repository to view the software our CanSat is working with, while also being able to directly contribute to it.

## Responsiblities breakdown
Each role mentioned in the table above has its own duties to fulfill in the team.
Below is a short analysis of what each role is responsible for.

- **Electrical Engineering**: designing the CanSat's circuit boards (PCBs) as well as ensuring all circuits are functioning as intended.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: designing & 3D modelling the CanSat's outer shell and inner (non-electronic) components.
- **Programming**: creating the software code for the CanSat.
- **Telemetry**: ensuring the CanSat can send the collected data to our base through transmissions.
- **Recovery**: creating the CanSat's parachute as well as recovering it after it has completed the mission.
- **Data Analysis**: analysing the data (i.e. plots) the CanSat sends during the mission.
- **Promotion**: promoting our project and finding potential sponsors to fund the project.
